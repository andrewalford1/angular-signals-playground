## Publishing to Github pages

To get this project to run on Github pages, I followed this tutorial:

When ready to push changes to the gh-pages branch, run these two commands:

```
ng build --output-path=dist --base-href="/angular-signals-playground/"
```

```
 ngh --dir=dist/browser
```

Q: Why would you want to use Angular signals?

A: Great question! Let’s break down why using signals in Angular might be a better approach, particularly for scenarios like this one:

### 1. **Automatic Reactivity:**

With signals, Angular handles reactivity **automatically**. Whenever a signal’s value changes, Angular knows which parts of the UI need to be updated. You don’t need to explicitly manage this reactivity, as you do with observables and subscriptions.

**Without signals (with subscriptions)**:

- You subscribe to observables and manually manage state changes.
- You need to unsubscribe (e.g., `takeUntilDestroyed`) to avoid memory leaks.

**With signals**:

- Signals automatically propagate changes to any dependent parts of the app.
- No need to manage subscriptions or lifecycle events like `ngOnDestroy`.

**Why it's better**: You focus less on plumbing (subscriptions) and more on logic. Signals update the UI automatically when data changes, making your code more declarative.

### 2. **Simplified State Management:**

In your original approach, you have to manage multiple subscriptions and state changes manually. With signals, the state is centralized and reactive by default.

**Without signals (imperative approach)**:

- You have to subscribe to observables, assign the results to variables, and manage when to reset or update state manually.

**With signals (reactive approach)**:

- You set the state once, and Angular’s reactivity system handles the rest. You don’t need to worry about manually updating the view when the state changes.

**Why it's better**: Signals provide cleaner and more maintainable state management by making your components more declarative and less error-prone (no need to manually track and manage the state updates).

### 3. **Cleaner Lifecycle Management**:

With observables and subscriptions, you have to explicitly handle unsubscriptions to avoid memory leaks (e.g., using `takeUntilDestroyed`). Signals don't require manual subscription or cleanup logic.

**Without signals**:

- You rely on RxJS operators like `takeUntilDestroyed` to unsubscribe and clean up after observables.

**With signals**:

- Angular manages the lifecycle of signals automatically. You don’t need to think about `ngOnDestroy` or unsubscribing.

**Why it's better**: Less manual cleanup code means less chance for mistakes like memory leaks, and it simplifies your component lifecycle management.

### 4. **Declarative Programming**:

Signals shift your code style to a **declarative** approach, which means describing **what** should happen rather than **how** to make it happen.

**Without signals**:

- You tell the system how to update state step-by-step (imperative).
- Example: `this.starWarsService.getEpisodes().subscribe(...)`

**With signals**:

- You declare the state and let Angular react to changes automatically.
- Example: `this.episodes.set(...)`

**Why it's better**: Declarative code is often more readable and easier to reason about. You describe the desired state and let Angular take care of the updates.

### Summary of Benefits:

- **Fewer Subscriptions**: Signals handle state changes without the need for manual subscriptions and unsubscribing.
- **Less Boilerplate**: You avoid lifecycle management boilerplate like `takeUntilDestroyed`.
- **Improved Readability**: Signals make your code more declarative, describing the data flow and logic more clearly.
- **Automatic Reactivity**: Angular’s change detection is more streamlined with signals, reducing the need for manual tracking of state changes.

### When Signals Are More Useful:

- **Simple State Management**: If your component has straightforward state transitions, signals can simplify how you manage data flows and reactivity.
- **Avoiding Boilerplate**: You no longer need to subscribe to observables manually or manage their lifecycle.

While this refactor doesn't drastically change how your component functions, it enhances maintainability, reactivity, and reduces the chance for common issues like memory leaks or mismatched state.

Does that make it clearer why signals might be a more robust approach for this use case?
